# singleton

The Singleton pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. It's useful when you want to control how and when an object is created, and you want to limit the number of instances to exactly one.

Here's a simple example in C++:

```cpp
class Singleton {
private:
    static Singleton* instance;
    Singleton() {}

public:
    // Deleting the copy constructor and the assignment operator to ensure no copies can be made.
    Singleton(Singleton &other) = delete;
    void operator=(const Singleton &) = delete;

    static Singleton* getInstance() {
        if (instance == nullptr) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
};

// Initialize pointer to zero so that it can be initialized in the first call to getInstance
Singleton* Singleton::instance = nullptr;
```

In this example, `Singleton` is a class that has a private constructor and a static method `getInstance`. The `getInstance` method checks if an instance of `Singleton` already exists. If it does, it returns the existing instance. If it doesn't, it creates a new instance and returns it. This ensures that there is at most one instance of `Singleton`.

The copy constructor and assignment operator are deleted to prevent creating another instance from a copy.

Please note that this simple example is not thread-safe. If you're working in a multithreaded environment, you'll need to use a thread-safe version of the Singleton pattern. This might involve using a mutex or other synchronization primitive to ensure that only one thread can create the instance at a time.

Also, in a real-world application, you would want to handle potential memory leaks and exceptions more carefully. For example, you might want to use smart pointers instead of raw pointers.
